# GoogleMassAccountMaker
Hi! As of this message I am currently a first year computer science student at york university. I recently decided that it might be a fun idea to try and 'exploit' googles account
creator system, theoretically allowing you to have an army of 'bots' at your fingertips that can be manipulated at any time be it through vote manipulation, follower manipulation 
or anything of the sort. While I never intended to use this for any malicious purposes I know that I cannot enforce this. As such I can simply appeal to your good natures and 
implore that under no circumstances should this be used for anything malicious.

with that out of the way this program is still very early in development. I thought it might be fun to leave this code/idea here and see how more experienced folks or people still
learning could try there hand at improving and making more effecient. The code in its current state is very rough, using a foreign website to randomly generate a number and acquire
the SMS message during verification, the AntiCaptchaClient to help bypass the recaptchas, and python selenium to automate the whole process. Both the website and AntiCaptchaClient 
are paid services that require an account.

That being said thank you for checking this out. If you have any feedback and/or changes that can be made later on in development I would love to hear it. This whole project was
intended as a fun learning experience, thank you and happy coding!
